# WhatsApp Assistant

Send WhatsApp messages to anyone without saving their phone number to your contacts list.

The app requires access to the phone call logs to get a list of your most recently contacted numbers. Since it is a restricted scope, I am not uploading the app to the Google Play Store.

You may download the APK file from the build folder.
